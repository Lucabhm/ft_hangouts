# ft_hangouts 📱  

A contact management mobile application built for the **42 curriculum**.  
The goal of this project is to become familiar with mobile systems by building an app that works on both **Android** and **iOS**, without external libraries.

## 🚀 Project Overview  

**ft_hangouts** is a simple mobile app that allows you to:  
- Create, edit, and delete contacts.  
- Store contacts in a dedicated **SQLite database** (not the system contacts).  
- Send and receive text messages with saved contacts.  
- View a clear conversation history (with sender/receiver distinction).  
- Display all contacts on the homepage with summaries.  
- Support **two languages** (switchable via system language).  
- Customize the header color via an in-app menu.  
- Show the last background timestamp in a toast when returning.  
- Work seamlessly in both **portrait and landscape modes**.  
- Use the **42 logo** as the app icon.
